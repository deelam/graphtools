# graphtools
Toolsuite of small, reusable tools to operate on graphs

## Big Picture
These tools are meant to 
* import data into graph representation
* export graphs into other formats
* facilitate use of "Big Data" tools (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Titan) 
* transform one graph representation into another graph with a different schema
* reduce boilerplate infrastructure code to expediate development

These tools use
* Tinkerpop's Blueprints interfce to be independent of graph implementations
* Currently focus on OLAP
 
By combining these tools, we can scalably import data in various formats and store it in graph databases; "merge" the graphs so they have a consistent schema; and analyze, extract, and transform the merged graph into desired output.

Problem characteristics
* There is no single graph schema to rule them all (for different datatypes, domains, and usecases).
* Interpretation of sourceData is not trivial -- requires domain knowledge.  Hence, we enable those experts to map the sourceData into a graph representation, which is more easily interpretable.
* Even when given a graph representation of the data, it needs to be translated into a graph schema that is at least compatible (if not consistent) with other graphs.
* It may not be efficient or reasonable to merge graphs, which duplicate data from the original graphs.  So, we want to minimize copying data when possible.

## Level 0 Tools

### Importer
Importing data into a graph is decomposed into 3 modular components: a domain-specific Parser, a domain-specific Encoder, and a Populator.  The user needs to provide domain-specific Encoder and Parser classes.  Existing implementations provide the gluecode and pipelining to accomplish the data import.  See [Importer](doc/importer.md).

### Exporter
Leverages existing exporting utilities provided by Bluepints.
* IORecord export(GraphRecord)

### Inspector (Graph Schema)
* extractSchema(graph)
* extractSchemaWithSamples(graph)
* extractSchemaWithStats(graph)
* diffSchemas(graph1,graph2)
* validateAgainstSchema(schema, graph)

## Level 1 Tools
### Translator
Used to filter node or edge types, collapse graph paths, or transform a graph into another graph.
* List\<GraphRecord> translate(GraphRecord)

### Enricher (append-only)
* void enrich(graph)

### Modifier (write and delete) (Level 1)
* void modify(graph)

### OLTP
Once in a graph database, use other tools to random access.
