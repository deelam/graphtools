 Create release version

    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.2.3
    mvn clean deploy -P deployment
    git commit -am "create release version 1.2.3" 

Push and tag release version

    git push origin master
    mvn scm:tag # creates and pushes a git tag where tagname is based on configuration set in pom 

Now create the next snapshot version so that subsequent changes are not being made to a release version

    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.2.4-SNAPSHOT
    mvn deploy # make a jar available in Maven repo so others can retrieve it
    git commit -am "advance to snapshot version 1.2.4-SNAPSHOT"
    git push origin master
    (optional) find . -iname '*.versionsBackup' | xargs rm # delete all pom.xml backup files created by mvn versions
